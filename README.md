## Features
This is a website with some basic info about a bunch of languages.
Most of the info presented on this website can be found on Wikipedia
or other websites, but I've tried to at least make this webpage look
better and be easier to use than Wikipedia. This website also comes
pre-loaded with fonts. So if you use some shitty operating system
like for some reason you use Windows 98, or Arch Linux, and you,
understandably, don't have Brahmi script fonts, or Eastern Syriac fonts,
or Phoenician or Runes or Imperial Aramaic fonts or whatever, then you
don't need to worry because fonts for strange scripts come with the site.

## History
This website was originally supposed to be an example of flexbox css
on a website for a webdesign class I had to take. I put it on a deployment
on github so my teacher could access it during COVID-19 lockdown. This
initial design philosophy lead to some problems down the line. I think
most of said problems are solved by now but it's still worth mentioning.

This project is from my old GitHub.
